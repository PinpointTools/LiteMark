## Major release: Awesomeness
Actual cool things. Obviously made by LLM and ideas by me, but I still test every single code and review them to make sure everything is stable.
- Export to HML
  - Allows you to export to HTML for no reason but, still cool.
- Keybindings
  - A set of keybinds, really awesome. Here are the lists:

| Keybind | Function |
| --- | --- |
| CTRL + [1-3] | Creates a heading text |
| CTRL + B | Creates a bold text |
| CTRL + I | Creates a italic text |
| CTRL + K | Creates a link text |
| CTRL + T | Creates a table |

# 0.1.0
## Inital Release
Literally the inital release. I don't know what you want from me.
