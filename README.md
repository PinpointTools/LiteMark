# LiteMark
A lightweight markdown editor. No Popups, no auto-updates, no nothing getting in your way making your markdown file. All is local and privacy and user first.

## Why choose this?
[I](https://codedave.pages.dev/) wanted a drag-and-drop markdown editor. Native and barely taking any resources. I didn't want to use Visual Studio Code or use a website. I wanted native.

So, that's why I made LiteMark. It's free, open source and native. Yeah, it might consume like 200-230mb of ram. But be happy that it's not made in electron and it's a native-like app.

## Is this vibe coded?
Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: Yes, but strictly reviewed by me. All code is made by `GPT-5.3-Codex` and reviewed by a human (me). Heavily tested the app and bug-fixing everything. All is working fine and perfect.
> (I'm even making this readme in the app right now lmao)

### Why not use Electron?
Electron in the big 26 is wild 🥀

Anyways, the reason is because of memory usage and storage hogging. I wanted to make a lightweight app instead of a memory and storage hogger.

### Why not use Tauri?
Tauri was my second option, but honestly? This app is just a "drag and drop" kinda thing app and Tauri for this app? Yeah, no. There's no backend to the system and honestly wont ever add one.

Absoultely! You can add as many things as you like. Extensions, themes, and such!

Yes! But, not anything with contacting the system whatsoever. We're not allowing system backend, annoying popups, or anything. We're all user and privacy first.
